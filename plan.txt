     Real-time Chat app  using Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and
     We use web socket and socket.io liberary to create a real-time chat app.
    
    First I will show my ui in which we will do chatiing in any where in the world and we can see who is typing and when he/she is typing.
    fisrt we put name in prompt in both pages and then we can write a message in in input box then we see our chats .
